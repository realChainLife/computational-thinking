# Computational Thinking for Developers

It’s been outlined in multiple guides including a Communications of the ACM essay by Jeannette Wing and several other computer scientists that computational thinking is a way of solving problems where a solution (of which there may be many), can be executed by a computer. Computational thinking for developers is the thought process that you run through even before you start writing code. At a high-level each of its principles will guide your software design and development from phase-to-phase until you’ve created a viable, real-world solution to a problem. And here it’s important to remember that ***the creativity that one can explore in software is only limited by creativity of human thought***.  


Now, whether you’re building a web-based solution, an iOS application, deploying containers or even managing libraries, it’s generally recommended that you apply these principles which some of you may already be familiar with, that is decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithmic thinking. Combined, these four principles will enable you to determine how good you are getting at writing and testing code. To illustrate how each principle is applicable, the repo contains code examples of each principle as it can be applied in your code writing and testing.
